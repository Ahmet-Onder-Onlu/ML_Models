# sparkMachineLearning House Price Prediction
Project Summary: Data Preprocessing and Modeling
Data Preparation and Cleaning for House Price Prediction:

Imputing Missing Values: Missing values in the total_bedrooms feature were handled using PySpark’s Imputer function.
Feature Selection and Transformation: Relevant features were selected, and irrelevant or low-impact features were removed. This process is crucial for improving model accuracy.
Feature Encoding:

Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables such as ocean_proximity were converted into numerical values using StringIndexer and OneHotEncoder. This ensures that models can work effectively with categorical data.
Feature Scaling and Vectorization:

Feature Vectorization: Numerical features were combined into a single vector using PySpark’s VectorAssembler function. This allows the model to process all numerical features together efficiently.
Pipeline Structure:

Using Pipeline: PySpark’s Pipeline class was used to automate the sequence of data preprocessing and modeling steps. This allowed for consistency and efficiency across models.
Modeling and Evaluation:

Testing Different Models: Various models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, GBTRegressor, and Generalized Linear Regression were tested. These models were evaluated using the CrossValidator method for cross-validation.
Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearch): To optimize the performance of the models, hyperparameters were tuned using ParamGridBuilder and CrossValidator.
Model Performance Evaluation:

RMSE and R² Metrics: Each model's performance was evaluated using the RMSE and R² metrics. These metrics helped assess the accuracy and overall performance of the models.
Visualization of Results:

Performance Comparison: The RMSE and R² values for each model were visualized using bar and line charts. This made it easier to compare the performance of each model.
Saving and Loading the Model:

Selecting and Saving the Best Model: Based on performance results, the best model, GBTRegressor, was saved. This model was stored in a directory using the save() function for future use.

#tsfresh_stock_analyse_model_train Stock Sector Classification
Project Summary: Sectoral Similarity Analysis and Classification Model for Stocks
1. Data Collection
Stock returns data from 2005 onwards was collected using libraries such as yfinance, investpy, and quandl.
Sector lists and stock data were retrieved using web scraping techniques.
2. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Missing values were filled using mean, median, or forward/backward fill methods.
Ensuring Stationarity: Log transformation and differencing techniques were applied to achieve stationarity in time series data.
Categorical Data Encoding: Sector information was converted into numerical values using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature Scaling: Features were scaled using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.
3. Feature Extraction and Selection
Feature Extraction: Statistical features were derived from time series data using the tsfresh library.
Feature Selection: The best features were selected using L1 regularization (Lasso), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
4. Model Development
Testing Different Models: Models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and CatBoost were tested.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Grid Search and Bayesian Optimization techniques were used for fine-tuning.
Cross-Validation: Cross-validation techniques were applied to enhance model generalization.
5. Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics: Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
Backtesting: The model's performance was tested on historical data.
6. Sectoral Similarity Analysis
The similarity of stocks to different sectors was analyzed.
For example, the extent to which real estate stocks resemble other sectors was examined.
7. Factor Analysis and Advanced Research
Financial indicators such as momentum, volatility, RSI, and MACD were computed and analyzed.
Additional data transformations were applied to enhance model performance.
